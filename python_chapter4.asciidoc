You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. This book explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools - and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork. Shouldn't you?
