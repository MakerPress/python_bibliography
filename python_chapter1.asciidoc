Head First Programming introduces the core concepts of writing computer programs -- variables, decisions, loops, functions, and objects -- which apply regardless of the programming language. This book offers concrete examples and exercises in the dynamic and versatile Python language to demonstrate and reinforce these concepts. Learn the basic tools to start writing the programs that interest you, and get a better understanding of what software can (and cannot) do. When you're finished, you'll have the necessary foundation to learn any programming language or tackle any software project you choose. This book uses the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, using a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.

This book approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with  the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. This book explores the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing,  and metaprogramming. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C# and VB.NET applications and uses IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell.
