<simpara>Twenty years ago, Guido van Rossum was hard at work on the first release of Python. A lot has changed in those twenty years. Many of the programming languages that were contemporaries of Python have started showing their age. Meanwhile there have been no shortages of new programming languages. However, Python continues to hold up well. Its emphasis on clean syntax and its melding of object-oriented and functional programming elements put it years ahead of the other popular languages from the '90s.</simpara>
<simpara>The story of Python is not just about it being ahead of its time in terms of syntax and features. It is also about its open development and the community around it. Its value as a scripting language is well known, and it ships with many operating systems. For years Python has been one of the P’s in the LAMP stack used for numerous web applications. Indeed Python’s popularity with web developers has lead to a multitude of web application frameworks written in Python: Django, TurboGears, Pylons, CherryPy, etc.</simpara>
<simpara>Technology moves fast as always, but Python remains on the cutting edge. NoSQL data stores have become increasingly popular, and you can find first class support for using Python with any of these technologies. This is just further evidence of the continued popularity of Python and the vibrant community around it. This bibliography contains a wide selection of books about Python. These range from various introductory to advanced books, to many books on more specific topics in Python. Of course, web development is covered, but you might be surprised to see the wide variety of other types of development that are done using Python.</simpara>
<simpara>Whether you are working on machine learning or just hacking in your spare time, Python&#8217;s got something to offer for you.</simpara>

<simpara>A user-friendly, object-oriented language, Python is quickly becoming the favorite introductory programming language among students and instructors. Many find Python to be a more lucid language than Java but with much of the functionality and therefore the ideal first language for those entering the world of Computer Science. This book is a clear, accessible introduction to the fundamental programming and problem solving concepts necessary for students at this level. The authors carefully build upon the many important computer science concepts and problem solving techniques throughout the text and offer relevant, real-world examples and exercises to reinforce key material. Programming skills throughout the text are linked to applied areas such as Image Processing, Cryptography, Astronomy, Music, the Internet, and Bioinformatics, giving students a well rounded look of its capabilities.</simpara>

<simpara>Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a wide variety of application domains such as Web, database access, desktop GUIs, game and software development, and network programming. Fans of Python use the phrase "batteries included" to describe the standard library, which covers everything from asynchronous processing to zip files. The language itself is a flexible powerhouse that can handle practically any application domain. This task-based tutorial is for students with no programming experience as well as those programmers who have some experience with the programming language and now want to take their skills to the next level. The book walks a reader through all the fundamentals and then moves on to more advanced topics. It&#8217;s a complete end-to-end tutorial and reference.</simpara>

<simpara>This book is designed to show developers how to use Python to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. The book&#8217;s main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications. Along the way, you will learn to create useful, efficient scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance. It is well-suited for developers who like to "learn by doing," rather than exploring a language feature by feature. To get the most out of the book, you should understand basic programming principles. This book will help you have fun with Python and build useful applications, all—unlike my experience with building a deck—without sore thumbs.</simpara>

<simpara>Python is fast becoming the programming language of choice for hackers, reverse engineers, and software testers because it&#8217;s easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy. But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. This book explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools - and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won&#8217;t cut it.

<simpara>As time goes on, system administrators are presented with increasingly complicated challenges. System administrators are gradually replacing their tools with more advanced and flexible ones. One of the choices is Python. Structurally, Python is a modern, high-level language with a very clean syntax. Python comes with many built-in libraries that can make automation tasks easier. It also has an extensive set of third-party libraries and a very active development community. This flexibility makes Python a good choice for a wide variety of tasks, from prototyping science applications to system maintenance and administration jobs. This book explains and shows how to apply Python scripting in practice. In this book, you will find several projects in the categories of network administration, web server administration, and monitoring and database management.</simpara>

<simpara>This book is directed at both industry practitioners and students interested in designing a pricing and risk management framework for financial derivatives using the Python programming language. It is a practical book complete with working, tested code that guides the reader through the process of building a flexible pricing framework in Python. The pricing frameworks' loosely coupled fundamental components have been designed to facilitate the quick development of new models. Concrete applications to real-world pricing problems are also provided. Topics are introduced gradually, each building on the last. They include basic mathematical algorithms, common algorithms from numerical analysis, trade, market and event data model representations, lattice and simulation based pricing, and model development. The book also provides a host of information on practical technical topics such as C++/Python hybrid development (embedding and extending) and techniques for integrating Python based programs with Microsoft Excel.</simpara>
