This book is the definitive reference guide to the Python programming language — the one authoritative handbook that reliably untangles and explains both the core Python language and the most essential parts of the Python library. Designed for the professional programmer, the book is concise, to the point, and highly accessible. It also includes detailed information on the Python library and many advanced subjects that is not available in either the official Python documentation or any other single reference source. Thoroughly updated to reflect the significant new programming language features and library modules that have been introduced in Python 2.6 and Python 3, this book is a guide for programmers who need to modernize existing Python code or who are planning an eventual migration to Python 3. Programmers starting a new Python project will find detailed coverage of contemporary Python programming idioms.

=== Python: Create-Modify-Reuse

_Wrox_
_By Jim Knowlton_
_ISBN: 9780470259320_
_July 2008_
_$39.99 US_
_287 pages_

This book is designed to show developers how to use Python to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. The book's main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications. Along the way, you will learn to create useful, efficient scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance. It is well-suited for developers who like to "learn by doing," rather than exploring a language feature by feature. To get the most out of the book, you should understand basic programming principles. This book will help you have fun with Python and build useful applications, all—unlike my experience with building a deck—without sore thumbs.
